    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
       I am an Assistant Professor in Electrical Engineering at B.P. Poddar Institute of Management and Technology, Kolkata, with over nine years of experience in teaching, research, and academic mentoring. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the National Institute of Technology (NIT) Silchar, where my research is centered on optimisation techniques, intelligent systems, and industrial automation.
    </p>

    <p>
        My academic interests lie in the design and analysis of computationally efficient optimisation algorithms and their application to intelligent control, automation, and cyber-physical systems. I have a strong research background in IoT-based system architectures, embedded and real-time systems, machine learning methodologies, and robotics integration, with an emphasis on developing scalable and reliable engineering solutions for complex industrial environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to research, I am actively engaged in curriculum development, laboratory instruction, and project-based learning. I have supervised and guided undergraduate and postgraduate student projects in areas such as real-time embedded systems, automation, and intelligent prototyping, including projects that have achieved recognition in national-level hackathons and technical forums. I place strong emphasis on bridging theoretical foundations with experimental validation and practical implementation.
    </p>
     <p>
       My long-term research vision is to contribute to high-impact scholarly work and academia–industry collaboration, addressing contemporary challenges in intelligent automation and optimisation, while fostering a research-oriented mindset among students and early-career engineers.
